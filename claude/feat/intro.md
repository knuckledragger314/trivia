We are going to make some changes to the frontend of this app.

I am going to add a series of mark up files that has questions and answers for new categories.

the main difference is for these, the questions will be much longer and be multiple choice.

The answer will show in place of the question, because the answer includes the question and answers
but will also explain why the answer is correct. And sometimes it will explain why other answers are wrong.

So the screen that we display for these other categories will be different the other ones, most likely. 

We will need to decide the best way. 

To start, we'll want a new directory called questions_and_answers. Then we will want two markup files. 
easy_aws_questions and easy_aws_answers.
