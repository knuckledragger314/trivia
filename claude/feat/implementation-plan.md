# Implementation Plan: Multiple-Choice Questions with Explanations

## Overview
Add support for longer, multiple-choice questions with detailed explanations alongside existing short-format trivia questions. New categories will display on the same category selection screen but route to a different question display experience.

## Milestone 1: Directory and File Setup
Create the directory structure and placeholder files for markdown content.

**Expected Outcome:**
- New `questions_and_answers/` directory created
- Empty markdown files `easy_aws_questions.md` and `easy_aws_answers.md` created
- Files ready for you to add content

## Milestone 1a: Edit Markdown Files
- Remove the headers "IAM Quiz", etc from both files
- Re-number them 1-x
- Add a, b, c, etc to the options for each question

## Milestone 2: Data Parsing and Map Creation
Read the markdown files and convert content to Map structure similar to existing questions_and_answers.dart.

**Expected Outcome:**
- New separate Dart file created to handle long-format questions
- Markdown content parsed and organized into Map structure like existing system
- Data accessible programmatically for use in app

## Milestone 3: Add "Easy AWS" Category
Create the new category and make it appear in the category selection grid.

**Expected Outcome:**
- "Easy AWS" category appears alongside existing categories
- Category properly integrated into existing category system
- Category selection works (even if it navigates to placeholder screen initially)

## Milestone 4: Basic Navigation Screen
Create a simple blank screen that can navigate back and forth between question and answer views.

**Expected Outcome:**
- New blank screen component with basic navigation controls
- Ability to switch between "Question View" and "Answer View" modes
- Back button navigation working properly
- Simple placeholder content to verify navigation works
- Route properly connected from "Easy AWS" category selection

## Milestone 5: UI Design and Content Integration
Once basic navigation is working, figure out how to properly display the longer question content in the UI.

**Expected Outcome:**
- Proper layout for displaying longer multiple-choice questions
- Readable answer explanations with appropriate formatting
- Good user experience for longer content
- Integration with actual markdown content
